## Creating SJW.ST

I've been thinking for a while it's about time I had my space on the internet. A place for me the ramble about current thought, hobbies and interests the a grand audience of 0 people.

Without the desire to learn the details of web development I decided on using a static website generator. After comparing [options](https://www.staticgen.com/) I settled on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a ruby based website generator, with the theme beautiful-jekyll created by [Dean Attali](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll). Jekyll had a number of great features that lead to my decision, posts can be written in markdown, and it has great integration with GitHub pages.

Using the readme I managed to create the website in under 30 minutes, fully customised and ready for this post!
