## Creating SJW.ST

I've been thinking for a while it's about time I had my space on the internet. A place for me the ramble about current thoughts, hobbies and interests to the world wide web, all 4.38 billion users...or the 3 people that might actually read this.

Without the desire to learn the details of full blown web development I decided on using a static website generator. After comparing [options](https://www.staticgen.com/) I settled on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a ruby based website generator, with the theme beautiful-jekyll created by [Dean Attali](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll). Jekyll had a number of great features that lead to this decision, posts can be written in markdown, it has great integration with GitHub pages and very quick hassle free setup. In fact, using the readme I managed to create the website in under 30 minutes, fully customised and ready for this post!
